# Pango designation

The latest maintained Pango-lineage designations.

Novel lineages or lineage refinements can be suggested by filing an issue with the respective sequence names, as found on GISAID, and any supporting information such as a phylogenetic tree for the putative lineage. 

Full details on how to suggest a new lineage can be found in the [Pango lineage designation guide](https://www.pango.network/how-does-the-system-work/how-to-suggest-a-new-lineage/).

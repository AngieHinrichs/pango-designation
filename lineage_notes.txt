A.1.3	Australian lineage (BS=100)
A.2	Spanish lineage (BS=60)
A.3	USA and Australian lineage (BS=20)
A.4	Lineage circulating in USA (BS=100)
A.5	A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A majoritively Spain/ South-American lineage, low bootstrap (16) but historically has had high support.

A.9 Indian lineage, previously A.p7 (BS=85)
B	Base of this lineage also lies in China, with many global exports, two distinct SNPs `8782TC` and `28144CT` define this lineage
B.2	A large lineage that now includes B.7 as a sublineage within it. Diversity within Hong Kong and Europe (BS=20)
